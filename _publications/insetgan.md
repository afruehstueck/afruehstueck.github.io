abstract:  While GANs can produce photo-realistic images in ideal conditions for certain domains, the generation of <b>full-body human images</b> remains difficult due to the diversity of identities, hairstyles, clothing, and the variance in pose. Instead of modeling this complex domain with a single GAN, we propose a novel method to <b>combine multiple pretrained GANs</b> where one GAN generates <b>a global canvas</b> (e.g., human body) and a <b>set of specialized GANs, or insets</b>, focus on different parts (e.g., faces, hands) that can be seamlessly inserted onto the global canvas. We model the problem as jointly exploring the respective latent spaces such that the generated images can be combined, by inserting the parts from the specialized generators onto the global canvas, without introducing seams. We demonstrate the setup by combing a full body GAN with a dedicated high-quality face GAN to produce plausible-looking humans. We evaluate our results with quantitative metrics and user studies.

  title : 'InsetGAN results'
  text :  'We show a comparison of several examples of StyleGAN2-generated full-body humans. We concentrate on regions that often exhibit unwanted artifacts in our generated results. Using our InsetGAN method, we are able to generate both faces and shoes using dedicated models and generate appropriate bodies for the respective combination. The result yields a seamless transition between the output of the three distinct generator models.'
